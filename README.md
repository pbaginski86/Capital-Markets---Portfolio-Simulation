# Capital-Markets---Portfolio-Simulation
Project code for my ML4T coursework that supports taking in a portfolio of stocks and outputting the portfolio value given a simulation of trades conducted.

# Machine Learning for Trading (Georgia Institute of Technology CS 7646)

## Introduction
A collection of code written fas part of my academic work in Machine Learning for Trading. It includes code that implements:

1. Random Trees (PERT â€“ Perfect Random Tree Ensembles, Cutler and Zhao) and Bagged Random Trees.
2. QLearning in Reinforcement Learning 
3. Stock market simulation/order book development using an ML strategry learner based on Bagged Ramdom Trees.
